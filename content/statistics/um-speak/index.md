Good morning dear faculty, staff, proud parents, guests, and fellow graduates. I am so happy to see you on this momentous moment. When it comes to speech, my brain would always follow an exponential distribution, and go memoryless. So please forgive me to use a script.

I must confess, when I prepared this speech, I struggled with what to say. As a student of applied statistics, I think I really should apply some stats to choose my word wisely. So I applied chatGPT. But soon I found that no matter how I trained the model, the words it gave me are far from satisfaction. Our life here are so distinct that statistically speaking, it has been an outlier for the AI to predict.

What did we do over the past two years? We enjoyed statistical theory, explored machine learning methods, honed our coding skills. We stayed up late for projects; we squeezed everything on the cheatsheet for exams; we applauded and cried for grades. Oh, not forgot to mention we also survived in the extreme winter, especially for those of us who experienced the electricity outage last year like me. These together, no matter happy or sad, define our time here and make it unique.

Today, as we celebrate, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the faculty and staff of our program. Thank you so much Professors Xu, Tan, Hsing, and all the esteemed faculty members for your invaluable guidance, wonderful lectures, and answering our stupid questions in the office hours. And thank you dear Kristen and all the dedicated staff. Your email replies are always so fast that I feel I already got your reply before I send my request.

And to my fellow graduates, thank you for sharing this journey with me. Now we are facing the new chapter of our life. I know some of us are going on exciting career paths, while others will continue their academic pursuits. Wherever your journey may take you, I firmly believe that the skills we get here will empower us for our future.

Our journey together may be ending, but our impact on the world is just beginning. In closing, congratulations to all of us. Thank you.
