In statistics, we often work with independently and identically distributed (iid) samples. For instance, consider a set of observations:
{{< math >}}
$
(X_1, X_2,\dots,X_{10}).
$
{{< /math >}}
However, what is the underlying sample space (a foundational concept from probability) associated with these samples? Specifically, let's take an element
{{< math >}}
$
\omega\in\Omega,
$
{{< /math >}}
where this
{{< math >}}
$
\omega
$
{{< /math >}}
represent an individual like Alice. How, then, could we use
{{< math >}}
$
X_1
$
{{< /math >}}
to denote Alice and, simultaneously,
{{< math >}}
$
X_2
$
{{< /math >}}
to denote another individual, say Bob?
