After graduating from my undergraduate studies, I moved to the United States to pursue my master's degree at the University of Michigan. Badminton once again became a way for me to connect with others, and I made many new friends through the sport.

However, without the systematic training I was used to, I noticed a decline in my physical condition, which affected my ability to maintain the aggressive, hard-hitting style of play (偏硬的球风) I had developed. As a result, I made a conscious decision to adapt my game.

I transitioned to a softer, more controlled style (偏软的球风), focusing on consistency in my strokes (击球动作一致性) and mastering control over the mid-to-back court (中后半场控制). This adjustment allowed me to continue enjoying the game while accommodating the changes in my physical endurance.

### Comparing My Playing Styles

Here is a video of my match with Li Linhao from my time at SUSTech, where I used my hard-hitting style (偏硬的球风). You can clearly see the difference in my approach compared to the softer, more controlled style I play with now.

### My Current Style at Michigan

Below are a couple of videos showcasing my matches during my time at Michigan, where you can see how I’ve adapted to a softer, more strategic approach:

Reflecting on my time at Michigan, badminton has continued to be more than just a sport for me—it’s been a bridge to new friendships and a way to adapt and grow both physically and mentally.
