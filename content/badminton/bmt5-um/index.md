After graduating from my undergraduate studies, I moved to the United States to pursue my master's degree at the University of Michigan. Badminton once again became a way for me to connect with others, and I made many new friends through the sport.

However, without the systematic training I was used to, I noticed a decline in my physical condition, which affected my ability to maintain the aggressive, hard-hitting style of play (偏硬的球风) I had developed. As a result, I made a conscious decision to adapt my game. 

I transitioned to a softer, more controlled style (偏软的球风), focusing on consistency in my strokes (击球动作一致性) and mastering control over the mid-to-back court (中后半场控制). This adjustment allowed me to continue enjoying the game while accommodating the changes in my physical endurance.

Reflecting on my time at Michigan, badminton has continued to be more than just a sport for me—it’s been a bridge to new friendships and a way to adapt and grow both physically and mentally.
