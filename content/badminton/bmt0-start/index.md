My badminton journey began during my senior year in the badminton club at [Yucai Middle School](https://www.cqyc.com/). At that time, our court was no more than a simple parking lot with a net strung across. Although the setup was basic, I had a lot of fun, and it was during these casual games that I first discovered my passion for badminton.

The next phase of my journey started at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](http://sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I received proper training. It was also here that I had the opportunity to attend live matches, which deepened my love for the sport.
