In 2019, I was fortunate to join the badminton team at the Southern University of Science and Technology. I focused on men's doubles, partnering with [Liu Chengyu](http://www.jiangxingyusustech.com/page131?article_id=64) (刘澄昱).

During my time on the team, I had the privilege of training under two exceptional coaches:

- [Sun Yu](https://bwfbadminton.com/player/92736/sun-yu) (孙瑜), a former world champion and professional badminton player,  
- [Zeng Yumin](http://sport.sustech.edu.cn/show-29-4-1.html) (曾煜民), a coach from the Guangdong Provincial Badminton Team.

Their expertise significantly enhanced my technical skills and strategic understanding of men's doubles badminton. Equally important were the bonds I formed with my teammates, particularly the strong partnership I built with Liu Chengyu.
